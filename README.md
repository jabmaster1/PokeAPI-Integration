I created a basic webpage with styling to remind you of a pokedex from the televison show. JavaScript and API integration were added to return basic pokemon information on request in the webpage.

1. 
-Created an input box where users can type the name of a pokemon

-Added a button that triggers when clicked.

-Used the PokeAPI to fetch pokemon data asynchronously

-When button is clicked it will make an API request to retrieve the pokemons information.

2. Display Data:
-Displayed pokemon's name and image on the page after fetching data

-Updates DOM dynamically based on the API response

3. Basic Error Handling:
-If the pokemon is not found the webpage will display a simple error message.

Bonus (Optional):
-Displays pokemon's type as well as name and image
